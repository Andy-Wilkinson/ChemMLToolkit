"""Farthest Point Sampler for pytorch Geometry package"""
__all__ = ['farthest_point_sampler']
def farthest_point_sampler(pos, npoints, start_idx=...):
    """Farthest Point Sampler without the need to compute all pairs of distance.

    In each batch, the algorithm starts with the sample index specified by ``start_idx``.
    Then for each point, we maintain the minimum to-sample distance.
    Finally, we pick the point with the maximum such distance.
    This process will be repeated for ``sample_points`` - 1 times.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pos : tensor
        The positional tensor of shape (B, N, C)
    npoints : int
        The number of points to sample in each batch.
    start_idx : int, optional
        If given, appoint the index of the starting point,
        otherwise randomly select a point as the start point.
        (default: None)

    Returns
    -------
    tensor of shape (B, npoints)
        The sampled indices in each batch.

    Examples
    --------
    The following exmaple uses PyTorch backend.

    >>> import torch
    >>> from dgl.geometry import farthest_point_sampler
    >>> x = torch.rand((2, 10, 3))
    >>> point_idx = farthest_point_sampler(x, 2)
    >>> print(point_idx)
        tensor([[5, 6],
                [7, 8]])
