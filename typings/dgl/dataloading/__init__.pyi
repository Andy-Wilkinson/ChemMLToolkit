"""The ``dgl.dataloading`` package contains:

* Data loader classes for iterating over a set of nodes or edges in a graph and generates
  computation dependency via neighborhood sampling methods.

* Various sampler classes that perform neighborhood sampling for multi-layer GNNs.

* Negative samplers for link prediction.

For a holistic explanation on how different components work together.
Read the user guide :ref:`guide-minibatch`.

.. note::
    This package is experimental and the interfaces may be subject
    to changes in future releases. It currently only has implementations in PyTorch.
