"""Server data"""
class ServerState:
    """Data stored in one DGL server.

    In a distributed setting, DGL partitions all data associated with the graph
    (e.g., node and edge features, graph structure, etc.) to multiple partitions,
    each handled by one DGL server. Hence, the ServerState class includes all
    the data associated with a graph partition.

    Under some setup, users may want to deploy servers in a heterogeneous way
    -- servers are further divided into special groups for fetching/updating
    node/edge data and for sampling/querying on graph structure respectively.
    In this case, the ServerState can be configured to include only node/edge
    data or graph structure.

    Each machine can have multiple server and client processes, but only one
    server is the *master* server while all the others are backup servers. All
    clients and backup servers share the state of the master server via shared
    memory, which means the ServerState class must be serializable and large
    bulk data (e.g., node/edge features) must be stored in NDArray to leverage
    shared memory.
