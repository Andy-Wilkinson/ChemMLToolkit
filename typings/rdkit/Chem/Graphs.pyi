""" Python functions for manipulating molecular graphs

In theory much of the functionality in here should be migrating into the
C/C++ codebase.

def CharacteristicPolynomial(mol, mat=...): # -> ndarray:
    """ calculates the characteristic polynomial for a molecular graph

      if mat is not passed in, the molecule's Weighted Adjacency Matrix will
      be used.

      The approach used is the Le Verrier-Faddeev-Frame method described
      in _Chemical Graph Theory, 2nd Edition_ by Nenad Trinajstic (CRC Press,
      1992), pg 76.
